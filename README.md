# Titianic-Logisitic-Regression

My project investigates the relationship between class and travel status (alone or with others) and survival of the 1912 Titanic disaster. This investigation uses data from individual passenger records from those aboard the Titanic. Class relates to the passenger class (first, second, third) that each passenger was in, while alone (No, yes) relates to wether the passenger boarded the Titanic with either a child, spouse, or parent.

My investigation into the Titanic disaster meant I was looking at the deaths of many passengers. For me, it was important to not let these real human lives and deaths turn into just statistics and instead remain the human element of what I was analyzing.
